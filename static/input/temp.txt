Dense Urban eMBB Rural eMBB Urban Macro Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication URLLC and Urban Macro massive Machine Type Communication mMTC Also 5G fulfils the service and the spectrum requirements Both component RITs NR and E-UTRALTE utilize the frequency bands below 7125 GHz including frequency bands identified for International Mobile Telecommunication IMT in the ITU Radio Regulations
In addition the NR component RIT can also utilize the frequency bands above 7125 GHz ie above 2425 GHz including frequency bands identified for IMT in the ITU Radio Regulations The complete set of standards for the terrestrial radio interface of IMT-2020 identified as 5G includes not only the key characteristics of IMT-2020 but also the additional capabilities of 5G both of which are continuing to be enhanced The 3GPP 5G System 5GS also includes specifications for its non-radio aspects such as the core network elements the EPC Network and 5GC Network security codecs network management etc These non-radio specifications are not included in the so-called Global Core Specifications GCS of IMT-2020 111 Overview of the component RIT E-UTRALTE The E-UTRALTE Component RIT is based on releases 15 and 16 of LTE and it is the evolution of the previous releases encompassing both FDD and TDD The E-UTRALTE RIT uses either 1 FDD operation and therefore is applicable for the operation with paired spectrum or 2 TDD operation and therefore is applicable for the operation with unpaired spectrum Both full-duplex and half-duplex FDD are supported Aggregation of TDD and FDD spectrum is supported Transmission bandwidths up to 640 MHz are supported yielding peak data rates up to roughly 32 Gbits in the downlink DL and 136 Gbits in the uplink UL
The downlink transmission scheme is based on conventional OFDM to provide a high degree of robustness against channel frequency selectivity while still allowing for low-complexity receiver implementations also at very large bandwidths 8 Rec ITU-R M2150-2 The uplink transmission scheme is based on Discrete Fourier Transform-Spread OFDM DFTS- OFDM The use of this transmission scheme for the uplink is motivated by the lower Peak-to- Average Power Ratio PAPR of the transmitted signal compared to conventional OFDM This allows for more efficient usage of the power amplifier in the User Equipment UE which translates into an increased coverage andor reduced terminal power consumption The uplink numerology subcarrier spacing and symbol duration is aligned with the downlink numerology
The Narrow-Band Internet of Things NB-IoT UL allows the allocation of a single-tone in addition to multi-tone DFTS-OFDM with the possibility of a lower subcarrier spacing in addition to the normal subcarrier spacing Channel coding is based on rate-13 turbo coding and is complemented by Hybrid-Automatic Repeat Request HARQ with soft combining to handle decoding errors at the receiver side Data modulation supports Quadrature Phase Shift Keying QPSK 16QAM 64QAM and 256QAM for both the downlink and the uplink
In downlink 1024QAM is also supported NB-IoT supports QPSK and 16-QAM on DL and for UL when multi-tones are allocated pi2-BPSK and pi4-QPSK are supported in UL when a single-tone is allocated NB-IoT DL channel coding is based on tail biting convolutional code eMTC supports QPSK 16QAM and 64QAM in DL and QPSK 16QAM in UL pi2-BPSK is supported in UL when two tones are allocated and QPSK is supported in UL for sub-PRB physical resource block allocation with more than two tones The E-UTRALTE RIT supports bandwidths from approximately 14 MHz to 640 MHz NB-IoT supports 200 kHz bandwidth Carrier aggregation ie the simultaneous transmission of multiple component carriers in parallel tofrom the same terminaleNB is used to support bandwidths greater than 20 MHz Component carriers do not have to be contiguous in frequency and can even be located in different frequency bands in order to enable exploitation of fragmented spectrum allocations by means of spectrum aggregation Carrier Aggregation CA supports the functionality to aggregate TDD bands with different uplink and downlink allocations as well as the functionality to support multiple timing advances Carrier Aggregation also supports aggregating FDD and TDD component carriers Dual Connectivity DC allows aggregating component carriers of different eNBs that are connected via a non-ideal backhaul Channel-dependent scheduling in both the time and frequency domains is supported for both downlink and uplink with the base-station scheduler being responsible for dynamically selecting the transmission resource as well as the data rate The basic operation is dynamic scheduling where the base-station scheduler takes a decision for each 1 ms Transmission Time Interval TTI but there is also a possibility for semi-persistent scheduling Apart from the basic TTI of 1ms E-UTRALTE supports shortened TTI of 23 OFDM symbols 142 μs and one slot 500 μs Semi-persistent scheduling enables transmission resources and data rates to be semi-statically allocated to a given User Equipment UE for a longer time period than one TTI in order to reduce the control-signalling overhead For better uplink coverage TTI bundling allows UEs to transmit in four consecutive TTIs NB-IoT and enhanced MTC eMTC allow for widespread coverage extension by means of scheduling multiple TTIs up to several thousands Multi-antenna transmission schemes are an integral part of E-UTRALTE RIT Multi-antenna precoding with dynamic rank adaptation supports both spatial multiplexing single-user Multiple Input Multiple Ouput MIMO and beam-forming Beam-forming by means of 2-dimensional antenna arrays can exploit the horizontal as well as the vertical spatial domains Spatial multiplexing with up to eight layers in the downlink and four layers in the uplink is supported Multi-user MIMO where multiple users are assigned the same time-frequency resources is also supported Coordinated MultiPoint CoMP operation is also supported where multiple transmission points or reception points are coordinated in their transmission or reception respectively The coordinated transmission points can belong to the same cell to different cells of the same eNB or to different cells of different Rec ITU-R M2150-2 9 eNBs A discovery reference signal can be used to identify transmission points or cells for CoMP andor Carrier aggregation operation Finally transmit diversity based on Space-Frequency Block Coding SFBC or a combination of SFBC and Frequency Switched Transmit Diversity FSTD is supported Inter-cell interference coordination ICIC where neighbouring cells exchange information aiding the scheduling in order to reduce interference is supported for the E-UTRALTE RIT ICIC can be used for homogenous deployments with non-overlapping cells of similar transmission power as well as for heterogeneous deployments where a higher-power cell overlays one or several lower-power cells In order to increase the potential of cell range expansion functionality exists for terminal-side interference mitigation of reference and synchronization signals as well as the broadcast channel A terminal-side mitigation of inter-cell interference caused by the data channel is supported with network assistance A network-side interference mitigation technique is supported which is based on the ability to turn on and off secondary cells Relaying functionality is included in E-UTRALTE RIT A relay node RN appears as a conventional e-Node B to UEs but is wirelessly backhauled to the remaining part of the radio-access network using the LTE Release 10 radio-interface technology E-UTRALTE RIT also supports sidelink communication via Proximity based Services ProSe UE-to-Network Relay E-UTRALTE RIT supports various types of machine-type communication In order to better address the low-cost segment a low-complexity terminal Category 0 is supported which has approximately 50 reduced modem complexity as compared to the least complex normal UE Category 1 Another 50 complexity reduction was made possible with eMTC Category M1 and even more with NB-IoT Category NB1 eMTC optionally supports half duplex HD operation and NB-IoT supports only HD
In addition eMTC and NB-IoT extended the original LTE coverage area by 15 dB and 20 dB respectively The narrow NB-IoT channel bandwidth of 200 kHz makes it possible to operate in re-farmed GSM channels or in LTE guardbands In order to improve UE power consumption a power saving State was introduced and extended Discontinuous Reception eDRX cycles range up to 1024 seconds in connected mode and 4369 minutes in idle mode For eMTC and NB-IoT it is possible to configure an additional uplink and an additional downlink carrier for traffic which is dedicated to a particular User Equipment whilst common transmissions such as synchronization signals and uplink transmissions during cell access occur on the same carrier for all UEs
In 3GPP Rel-16 spectral efficiency is increased further for massive-MTC transmissions and reduced energy consumption for massive-MTC devices enabled eg uplink transmission using preconfigured resources in idle mode allowing the device to skip random access procedures and multi-transport-block scheduling in both the DL and UL transmission directions reducing the control signalling overhead Sidelink transmissions are defined for ProSe Direct Discovery and ProSe Direct Communication between UEs ProSe Direct Communication is targeting only Public Safety applications and allows terminals to communicate with each other directly without routing the data via the eNB
ProSe Direct Discovery allows discovering other terminals in close proximity Direct communication is also supported when a terminal is out of LTE network coverage Vehicular communication services can be provided by PC5 interface andor Uu interface Support of vehicle-to-everything V2X services via PC5 interface is provided by V2X sidelink communication E-UTRALTE RIT supports also Multicast Broadcast Multimedia Service MBMS allowing for multiple cells to jointly transmit multicastbroadcast data forming a single frequency network Multiple subcarrier spacings and cyclic prefixes are supported targeting different use cases eg handheld car-mounted rooftop and different inter-site distances up to 100km ISD E-UTRALTE RIT supports both mixed unicastMBMS carriers and dedicated MBMS carriers In order to enhance mobility robustness and performance additional LTE mobility enhancements are introduced in 3GPP Rel-16 User data interruption is reduced during handover to 0 ms by dual-active- 10 Rec ITU-R M2150-2 protocol-stack handover
In addition the robustness during handover is improved by conditional handover 1111
Network architecture The radio-access network of E-UTRALTE RIT has a flat architecture with a single type of node the eNodeB which is responsible for all radio-related functions in one or several cells The eNodeB is connected to the core network via the S1 interface more specifically to the serving gateway S-GW by means of the user-plane part S1-u and to the Mobility Management Entity MME by means of the control-plane part S1-c One eNodeB can connect to multiple MMEsS-GWs for the purpose of load sharing and redundancy MMEsS-GWs can be reselected for support of separate dedicated core networks that are designed to meet the requirements of a certain group of devicescustomers The X2 interface connecting eNodeBs to each other is mainly used to support active-mode mobility This interface may also be used for multi-cell Radio Resource Management RRM functions such as ICIC or CoMP The X2 interface is also used to support lossless mobility between neighbouring cells by means of packet forwarding The architecture is shown in Fig 1 FIGURE 1 Radio-access network interfaces 1112 Layer 2 protocol architecture Layer 2 L2 consists of several sub-layers Packet Data Convergence Protocol PDCP Radio Link Control RLC and Medium Access Control MAC

Rec ITU-R M2150-2 Packet filtering for Prose Direct Communication In case of DC the UE is configured with two independent MAC entities one for MCG and one for SCG The MAC offers services to the RLC in the form of logical channels A logical channel is defined by the type of information it carries and is generally classified as a control channel used for transmission of control and configuration information necessary for operating an E-UTRALTE RIT system or as a traffic channel used for the user data The set of logical-channel types specified for E-UTRALTE RIT includes Broadcast Control Channel BCCH used for broadcasting system control information Bandwidth Reduced Broadcast Control Channel BR-BCCH used for broadcasting system control information to bandwidth limited eMTC

A transport channel is defined by how and with what characteristics the information is transmitted over the radio interface Data on a transport channel is organized into transport blocks In each Transmission Time Interval TTI at most one or two in case of spatial multiplexing transport blocks are transmitted per component carrier Associated with each transport block is a Transport Format TF specifying how the transport block is to be transmitted over the radio interface The transport format includes information about the transport-block size the modulation scheme and the antenna mapping The scheduler is responsible for dynamically determining the uplink as well as downlink transport format in each TTI Rec ITU-R M2150-2 15 The following transport-channel types are defined The Broadcast Channel BCH has a fixed transport format provided by the specifications It is used for transmission of parts of the BCCH system information more specifically the so-called Master Information Block MIB Paging Channel PCH is used for transmission of paging information from the PCCH logical channel The PCH supports DRX to allow the mobile terminal to save battery power by waking up to receive the PCH only at predefined time instants The downlink Shared Channel DL-SCH is the main transport-channel type used for transmission of downlink data in E-UTRALTE RIT The DL-SCH supports dynamic rate adaptation and channel-dependent scheduling HARQ with soft combining and spatial multiplexing It also supports DRX to reduce mobile-terminal power consumption while still providing an always-on experience The DL-SCH is also used for transmission of the parts of the BCCH system information not mapped to the BCH For transmission to a terminal using multiple component carriers the UE receives one DL-SCH per component carrier The Multicast Channel MCH is used to support MBMS
It is characterized by a semi-static transport format and semi-persistent scheduling In case of multi-cell transmission using MBSFN the scheduling and transport format configuration is coordinated among the cells involved in the MBSFN transmission The Uplink Shared Channel UL-SCH is the uplink counterpart to the DL-SCH ie it is the uplink transport channel used for transmission of uplink data The Random Access Channel RACH is also defined as an uplink transport channel although it does not carry transport blocks The RACH is used in the uplink to respond to the paging message or to initiate the move to the RRC_CONNECTED state according to terminal data transmission needs The Sidelink Broadcast Channel SL-BCH uses a pre-defined transport format The Sidelink Discovery Channel SL-DCH supports both UE autonomous resource selection and scheduled resource allocation by eNodeB it uses a fixed size pre-defined format periodic broadcast transmission The Sidelink Shared Channel SL-SCH supports both UE autonomous resource selection and scheduled resource allocation by eNodeB it supports HARQ combining and dynamic link adaptation by varying the transmit power modulation and coding The mapping between logical channels transport channels and physical channels is illustrated in Fig 4 for the downlink Fig 5 for the uplink Fig 6 for the sidelink Fig 7 for the NB-IoT downlink and Fig 8 for the NB-IoT uplink 16 Rec ITU-R M2150-2 FIGURE 4 Downlink channel mapping FIGURE 5 Uplink channel mapping FIGURE 6 Sidelink channel mapping Rec ITU-R M2150-2 17 FIGURE 7 NB-IoT DL channel mapping FIGURE 8 NB-IoT UL channel mapping 1113 Physical layer

Indicator Channel PHICH used to convey the ACKNAK information for UL PUSCH transmissions received at the eNodeB Three different types of physical channels are defined for the uplink Physical Random Access Channel PRACH used to convey a preamble which is used to trigger a random-access procedure in the eNodeB Physical Uplink Shared Channel PUSCH used to convey both user data and upper layer control information Rec ITU-R M2150-2 19 Physical Uplink Control Channel PUCCH used to convey control information scheduling requests CQI PMI RI HARQ ACKNAK for PDSCH etc
The following types of physical channels are defined for the sidelink Physical sidelink broadcast channel PSBCH used to carry system and synchronization related information transmitted from the UE Physical sidelink discovery channel PSDCH used to carry ProSe Direct Discovery message from the UE Physical sidelink control channel PSCCH used to carry control from a UE for ProSe Direct Communication Physical sidelink shared channel PSSCH used to carry traffic from a UE for ProSe Direct Communication The following types of physical channels are defined for NB-IoT Narrowband Physical broadcast channel NPBCH used to carry the BCH for NB-IoT UEs Used for conveying cell andor system specific information using a transport block mapped to sixty four subframes within a 640 ms interval Narrowband Physical downlink shared channel NPDSCH used to carry the DL-SCH and PCH for NB-IoT UEs Narrowband Physical downlink control channel NPDCCH used to inform the NB-IoT UE about the resource allocation of PCH and DL-SCH Carries the uplink scheduling grant for the NB-IoT UE Carries the direct indication information Narrowband Physical uplink shared channel NPUSCH used to carry the UL-SCH and Hybrid ARQ ACKNAKs in response to downlink transmission for the NB-IoT UE Narrowband Physical random access channel NPRACH used to carry the random access preamble for the NB-IoT UE 11132 Time-domain structure and duplex schemes Figure 10 illustrates the high-level time-domain structure for transmission with each radio frame of length 10 ms consisting of ten equally sized subframes of length 1 ms Each subframe consists of two equally sized slots of length Tslot 05 ms with each slot consisting of a number of OFDM symbols including cyclic prefix For MBSFN transmission slots of 1 ms and 3 ms are additionally defined 20 Rec ITU-R M2150-2 FIGURE 10 E-UTRALTE RIT time-domain structure The E-UTRALTE RIT can operate in both FDD and TDD modes as illustrated in Fig 11 Although the time-domain structure is in most respects the same for FDD and TDD there are some differences between the two duplex modes most notably the presence of a special subframe in the case of TDD The special subframe is used to provide the necessary guard time for downlink-to-uplink switching FIGURE 11 Uplinkdownlink timefrequency structure for FDD and TDD For FDD operation upper part of Fig 11 there are two carrier frequencies for each component carrier one for uplink transmission fUL and one for downlink transmission fDL During each frame there are thus ten uplink subframes and ten downlink subframes and uplink and downlink Rec ITU-R M2150-2 21 transmission can occur simultaneously within a cell Half-duplex operation at the UE side is supported by the scheduler ensuring non-simultaneous reception and transmission at the UE For TDD operation lower part of Fig 11 there is only a single carrier frequency per component carrier and uplink and downlink transmissions are always separated in time also on a cell basis As seen in the figure some subframes are allocated for uplink transmissions and some subframes for downlink transmission with the switch between downlink and uplink occurring in the special subframe
The special subframe is split into three parts a downlink part DwPTS a guard period GP where the switch occurs and an uplink part UpPTS The DwPTS is in essence treated as a normal downlink subframe although the amount of data that it is possible to transmit is smaller due to the reduced length of the DwPTS
The UpPTS can be used for channel sounding or random access The DwPTS GP and UpPTS have configurable individual lengths to support different deployment scenarios and a total length of 1 ms Different asymmetries in terms of the amount of resources allocated for uplink and downlink transmission respectively are provided through seven different downlinkuplink configurations as shown in Fig 12 Where carrier aggregation is employed the downlinkuplink configuration is identical across component carriers in the same band and may be the same or different across component carriers in different bands Coexistence between the E-UTRALTE RIT and other IMT-2000 TDD systems such as TD-SCDMA is catered for by aligning the switch points between the two systems and selecting the appropriate special subframe configuration and uplink-downlink
asymmetry FIGURE 12 Uplink-downlink asymmetries supported by the E-UTRALTE RIT 22 Rec ITU-R M2150-2 Sidelink transmissions use the same frame structure as the frame structure that is defined for uplink and downlink when UEs are in network coverage However the sidelink transmissions are restricted to a subset of the uplink resources in time and frequency domain The physical channel structure is similar to uplink transmissions and the same basic transmission scheme as the UL transmission scheme is used However sidelink is limited to single cluster transmissions and it uses a one symbol gap at the end of each sidelink subframe 11133 Physical layer processing To the transport blocks to be transmitted on a DL-SCH or UL-SCH a Cyclic Redundancy Check is attached followed by rate-13 Turbo coding for error correction tail biting convolutional code for NPDSCH Rate matching is used not only to match the number of coded bits to the amount of resources allocated for the DL-SCHUL-SCH transmission but also to generate the different redundancy versions as controlled by the HARQ protocol When spatial multiplexing is employed the processing is duplicated for the two transport blocks After rate matching the coded bits are modulated QPSK 16QAM 64QAM 256QAM and 1024QAM in DL and QPSK 16QAM 64QAM 256QAM in UL
In the case of multi-antenna transmission the modulation symbols are mapped to multiple layers and precoded before being mapped to the different antenna ports Alternatively transmit diversity can be applied Finally the precoded modulation symbols are mapped to the time-frequency resources allocated for the transmission Downlink transmission is based on conventional OFDM with a cyclic prefix The subcarrier spacing is f 15 kHz and two cyclic prefix lengths are supported normal cyclic prefix 47 µs and extended cyclic prefix 167 µs
In the frequency domain the number of resource blocks can range from 6 to 100 per component carrier for channel bandwidths ranging from 14 to 20 MHz respectively where a resource block is 180 kHz in the frequency domain There can be up to 32 component carriers transmitted in parallel implying an overall bandwidth up to 640 MHz In inband mode NB-IoT allocates a single resource block In standalone mode NB-IoT uses a channel bandwidth of 200 kHz Uplink transmission is based on Discrete Fourier Transform DFT Spread OFDM DFTS-OFDM DFTS-OFDM can be seen as a DFT precoder followed by conventional OFDM with the same numerology as in the downlink The NB-IoT UL allows allocation of a single-tone with f 375 kHz or f 15 kHz subcarrier spacing Multiple DFT precoding sizes corresponding to transmission with different scheduled bandwidths can be used The remaining downlink transport channels PCH BCH MCH are based on the same general physical-layer processing as DL-SCH although with some restrictions in the set of features used MCH supports additional subcarrier spacings of 0370 125 25 and 75 kHz are supported with cyclic prefixes up to 300 µs 11134 Multi-antenna transmission A wide range of multi-antenna transmission schemes are supported in the downlink Single-antenna transmission using a single cell-specific reference signal Closed-loop spatial multiplexing also known as codebook-based beam-forming or precoding of up to four layers using cell-specific reference signals Feedback reports from the terminal are used to assist the eNodeB in selecting a suitable precoding matrix Open-loop spatial multiplexing also known as large-delay cyclic delay diversity of up to four layers using cell-specific reference signals Spatial multiplexing of up to eight layers using UE-specific reference signals The eNodeB may use feedback reports or exploit channel reciprocity to set the beam-forming weights Rec ITU-R M2150-2 23

Each grant is transmitted on a separate PDCCH using QPSK modulation and cell-specific reference signals
The EPDCCHMPDCCH is transmitted in pairs of Physical Resource Blocks PRBs multiplexed in frequency with the PDSCH it carries downlink and uplink scheduling grants consisting of UE identity time-frequency resources and transport format The EPDCCHMPDCCH uses QPSK modulation and demodulation reference signals and it may use either frequency-localized or frequency-distributed transmission For NB-IoT the NPDCCH is transmitted in all available OFDM symbols of pairs of PRBs with no multiplexing with NPDSCH it carries downlink and uplink scheduling grants consisting of UE identity time-frequency resources and transport format The NPDCCH uses QPSK modulation and narrowband reference signals Sidelink resource allocation can be transmitted on the PDCCHEPDCCH 24 Rec ITU-R M2150-2 Uplink control information UCI consisting of CSI scheduling requests and hybrid-ARQ acknowledgements is transmitted at the band edges of the primary uplink component carrier Alternatively parts of the control signalling can be multiplexed with data on PUSCH

The active bandwidth part defines the UEs operating bandwidth within the cells operating bandwidth For initial access and until the UEʼs configuration in a cell is received the initial bandwidth part detected from system information is used Downlink and uplink transmissions are organized into frames of 10 ms duration consisting of ten 1 ms subframes Each frame is divided into two equally sized half-frames of five subframes The slot duration is 14 symbols with Normal CP and 12 symbols with Extended CP and scales in time as a function sub-carrier spacing in use so that there is always an integral number of slots in a subframe Timing Advance TA is used to adjust the uplink frame timing relative to the downlink frame timing FIGURE 33 Uplink-downlink timing relation Operation on both paired and unpaired spectrum is supported 21142 Downlink 211421 Downlink transmission scheme A closed loop Demodulation Reference Signal DMRS based spatial multiplexing is supported for Physical Downlink Shared Channel PDSCH Up to 8 and 12 orthogonal DL DMRS ports are supported for type 1 and type 2 DMRS respectively Up to 8 orthogonal DL DMRS ports per UE are supported for Single-User MIMO SU-MIMO and up to 4 orthogonal DL DMRS ports per UE are supported for Multi-User MIMO MU-MIMO The number of SU-MIMO code words is one for 1-4 layers transmissions and two for 5-8 layers transmissions The DMRS and corresponding PDSCH are transmitted using the same precoding matrix and the UE does not need to know the precoding matrix to demodulate the transmission The transmitter may use different precoder matrix for different parts of the transmission bandwidth resulting in frequency selective precoding The UE may also assume that the same precoding matrix is used across a set of Physical Resource Blocks PRBs denoted Precoding Resource Block Group PRG Transmission durations from 2 to 14 symbols in a slot with a single PDSCH is supported Aggregation of multiple slots with Transport Block TB repetition is supported From Rel-16 enhancements for DLUL MIMO are introduced including enhancements on multi- Transmission Reception Points TRPs or multi-panel transmission improving reliability and robustness with both ideal and non-ideal backhaul 211422 Physical-layer processing for physical downlink shared channel The downlink physical-layer processing of transport channels consists of the following steps TB CRC attachment code block segmentation and code block CRC attachment channel coding Low Density Parity Check LDPC coding 178 Rec ITU-R M2150-2 physical-layer hybrid-ARQ processing rate matching scrambling modulation QPSK 16QAM 64QAM 256QAM and 1024QAM layer mapping mapping to assigned resources and antenna ports The UE may assume that at least one symbol with demodulation reference signal is present on each layer in which PDSCH is transmitted to a UE and up to three additional DMRS symbols can be configured by higher layers Phase tracking RS may be transmitted on additional symbols to aid receiver phase tracking 211423 Physical downlink control channels The Physical Downlink Control Channel PDCCH can be used to schedule DL transmissions on PDSCH and UL transmissions on PUSCH where the Downlink Control Information DCI on PDCCH includes downlink assignments containing at least modulation and coding format resource allocation and HARQ information related to DL-SCH uplink scheduling grants containing at least modulation and coding format resource allocation and HARQ information related to UL-SCH
In addition to scheduling PDCCH can be used for activation and deactivation of configured PUSCH transmission with configured grant activation and deactivation of PDSCH semi-persistent transmission notifying one or more UEs of the slot format notifying one or more UEs of the PRBs and OFDM symbols where the UE may assume no transmission is intended for the UE transmission of Transmit Power Control TPC commands for PUCCH and PUSCH transmission of one or more TPC commands for Sounding Reference Signal SRS transmissions by one or more UEs Switching a UEs active bandwidth part Initiating a random access procedure Indicating the UEs to monitor the PDCCH during the next occurrence of the DRX on- duration In IAB context indicating the availability for soft symbols of an IAB-DU Triggering one shot HARQ-ACK codebook feedback A UE monitors a set of PDCCH candidates in the configured monitoring occasions in one or more configured COntrol REsource SETs CORESETs according to the corresponding search space configurations A CORESET consists of a set of PRBs with a time duration of 1 to 3 OFDM symbols The resource units Resource Element Groups REGs and Control Channel Elements CCEs are defined within a CORESET with each CCE consisting a set of REGs Control channels are formed by aggregation of CCEs Different code rates for the control channels are realized by aggregating different number of CCEs Interleaved and non-interleaved CCE-to-REG mapping are supported in a CORESET Rec ITU-R M2150-2 179 The PDCCH repetition is operated by using two search spaces which are explicitly linked by configuration provided by the RRC layer and are associated with corresponding CORESETs
For PDCCH repetition two linked search spaces are configured with the same number of candidates and two PDCCH candidates in two search spaces are linked with the same candidate index When PDCCH repetition is scheduled to a UE an intra-slot repetition is allowed and each repetition has the same number of CCEs and coded bits and corresponds to the same DCI payload Polar coding is used for PDCCH Each resource element group carrying PDCCH carries its own DMRS QPSK modulation is used for PDCCH 211424 Synchronization signal and PBCH block The Synchronization Signal and PBCH block SSB consists of primary and secondary synchronization signals PSS SSS each occupying 1 symbol and 127 subcarriers and PBCH spanning across three OFDM symbols and 240 subcarriers but on one symbol leaving an unused part in the middle for SSS as show in Fig 34
The possible time locations of SSBs within a half-frame are determined by sub-carrier spacing and the periodicity of the half-frames where SSBs are transmitted is configured by the network During a half-frame different SSBs may be transmitted in different spatial directions ie using different beams spanning the coverage area of a cell Within the frequency span of a carrier multiple SSBs can be transmitted The Physical Cell Identifiers PCIs of SSBs transmitted in different frequency locations do not have to be unique ie different SSBs in the frequency domain can have different PCIs However when an SSB is associated with a Remaining Minimum System Information RMSI the SSB corresponds to an individual cell which has a unique NR Cell Global Identifier NCGI
Such an SSB is referred to as a Cell-Defining SSB CD-SSB A PCell is always associated to a CD-SSB located on the synchronization raster 180 Rec ITU-R M2150-2 FIGURE 34 Time-frequency structure of SSB Polar coding is used for the PBCH The UE may assume a band-specific sub-carrier spacing for the SSB unless a network has configured the UE to assume a different sub-carrier spacing PBCH symbols carry their own frequency-multiplexed DMRS QPSK modulation is used for PBCH 211425 Physical layer procedures 2114251 Link adaptation Link adaptation Adaptive Modulation and Coding AMC with various modulation schemes and channel coding rates is applied to the PDSCH

Five formats of PUCCH exist depending on the duration of PUCCH and the UCI payload size format 0 short PUCCH of 1 or 2 symbols with small UCI payloads of up to two bits with UE multiplexing capacity of up to 6 UEs with 1-bit payload in the same PRB format 1 long PUCCH of 4 to 14 symbols with small UCI payloads of up to two bits with UE multiplexing capacity of up to 84 UEs without frequency hopping and 36 UEs with frequency hopping in the same PRB format 2 short PUCCH of 1 or 2 symbols with large UCI payloads of more than two bits with no UE multiplexing capability in the same PRBs format 3 long PUCCH of 4 to 14 symbols with large UCI payloads with no UE multiplexing capability in the same PRBs format 4 long PUCCH of 4 to 14 symbols with moderate UCI payloads with multiplexing capacity of up to 4 UEs in the same PRBs The short PUCCH format of up to two UCI bits is based on sequence selection while the short PUCCH format of more than two UCI bits frequency-multiplexes the UCI and the DMRS
The long PUCCH formats time-multiplex the UCI and DMRS Frequency hopping is supported for long PUCCH formats and for short PUCCH formats of duration of two symbols Short and long PUCCH formats can be repeated over multiple slots or sub-slots where the repetition factor is either indicated dynamically in the DCI or semi-statically in an RRC configuration UCI multiplexing in the PUSCH is supported when UCI and PUSCH transmissions coincide in time either due to transmission of a UL-SCH transport block or due to triggering of A-CSI transmission without UL-SCH transport block In addition HARQ-ACK multiplexing of a certain priority in PUSCH of a different priority is supported when HARQ-ACK and PUSCH transmissions coincide in time either due to transmission of a UL-SCH transport block or due to triggering of A-CSI transmission without UL-SCH transport block UCI carrying HARQ-ACK feedback with 1 or 2 bits is multiplexed by puncturing the PUSCH
In all other cases the UCI is multiplexed by rate matching the PUSCH Rec ITU-R M2150-2 183 UCI consists of the following information CSI ACKNAK Scheduling request Simultaneous transmission of PUCCH and PUSCH associated with different priorities on cells of different bands in a PUCCH group is supported where UCI multiplexing in the PUCCH associated with a priority in combination of UCI multiplexing in a PUSCH associated with a different priority is supported if the UCI multiplexed on PUSCH is of same priority as the PUSCH QPSK and π2 BPSK modulation can be used for long PUCCH with more than 2 bits of information QPSK is used for a short PUCCH with more than 2 bits of information and BPSK and QPSK modulation can be used for a long PUCCH with up to 2 information bits Transform precoding is applied to a long PUCCH Channel coding used for uplink control information is described in Table 5 TABLE 5 Channel coding for uplink control information Uplink control information size including CRC if present Channel code 1 Repetition code 2 Simplex code 3-11 Reed Muller code 11 Polar code 211434 Random access Random access preamble sequences of different lengths are supported The sequence length 839 is applied with subcarrier spacings of 125 and 5 kHz and the sequence length 139 is applied with subcarrier spacings of 15 30 60 120 480 and 960 kHz sequence length of 571 is applied with subcarrier spacings of 30 120 and 480 kHz and sequence length 1151 is applied with subcarrier spacings of 15 and 120 kHz respectively Sequence length 839 supports unrestricted sets and restricted sets of Type A and Type B while sequence lengths 139 571 and 1151 support unrestricted sets only Multiple PRACH preamble formats are defined with one or more PRACH OFDM symbols and different cyclic prefixes and guard times The PRACH preamble configuration to use is provided to the UE in the system information The UE calculates the PRACH transmit power for the retransmission of the preamble based on the most recent estimated pathloss and the power ramping counter value

The specification is in general a beam-based technology to support both these spectrum bands For the downlink transmissions the DMRS is designed to support up to 12 users via MU-MIMO techniques in the downlink via 12 orthogonal DMRS ports Specifically a maximum of 8 orthogonal DL DMRS ports per UE are allowed in the Single-User MIMO SU-MIMO mode of operation and a maximum of 4 orthogonal DL DMRS ports per UE are supported for Multi-User MIMO MU- MIMO mode The number of SU-MIMO code words is one for 1 to 4 layers transmissions and two for 5 to 8 layers transmissions
The specification supports both codebook-based and non-codebook-based precoding mechanisms for MIMO transmissions For codebook-based mechanisms two kinds of CSI feedback mechanisms are supported mainly Type-I and Type-II aka low-resolution and high-resolution CSI feedback Efforts are made to ensure the feedback from the users is minimized and yet achieve significant gains in the downlink transmission in MU-MIMO mode For the case of uplink closed loop DMRS based spatial multiplexing is supported For a given user a maximum of up to four-layer transmissions are supported while the number of codewords is limited to one When transform precoding is used ie DFT-s-OFDM transmission only a single MIMO layer transmission is supported The specification also supports multiple transmission-reception points such as in the case of coordinated multiple point transmission multiple antenna panel transmissions among others These support use cases such as avoiding blockages in higher frequencies and enhance reliability 3125 Support for URLLC The RIT supports ultra-reliable and low latency communications which is useful in many industry verticals such as smart factories industry automation smart cities among others The reliability level that can be achieved is 999999 and very low latency is supported The control plane and user plane latencies are ensured to be less than 10 ms and 1 ms respectively Some main technical features that are part of the RIT to support this feature are 1 Shaped Pi2 BPSK modulation scheme to support higher reliability even at low SNRs 2 Mini-slot less than 1 full slot transmissions to support fast transmissions and faster ACKNACK feedback mechanisms 3 Different numerologies to support smaller slot durations to aid URLLC transmissions 4 Repetitions across slots slot aggregation higher aggregation levels for control channel a separate MCSCQI table 5 Traffic pre-emption to allow URLLC data packets through 6 Restrictions on logical channel priorities 7 Supporting packet duplication via dual connectivity and carrier aggregation 8 Ethernet header compression to reduce the latency among others As can be seen the features are across various protocol layers to ensure a true low latency mechanism 3126 HARQ HARQ functionality ensures delivery of packets between peer entities at Physical layer When the Physical layer is not configured for downlinkuplink spatial multiplexing HARQ process supports only one TB When the Physical layer is configured HARQ process supports one or more TBs Rec ITU-R M2150-2 275 3127 Supplementary Uplink SUL
In case of supplementary Uplink SUL UE will be configured with two Uplinks 2 ULs for one Downlink of the same cell The uplink transmissions on both ULs are controlled by the network to avoid overlapping of transmissions in PUSCHPUCCH in time Note Overlapping transmissions on PUSCH are avoided through scheduling Overlapping transmissions on PUCCH are avoided through configuration PUCCH can only be configured for only one of the two ULs of the cell In addition to these initial access is supported on each of the uplink 3128 Carrier Aggregation CA
In TSDSI RIT with carrier aggregation multi carrier nature of physical layer is exposed to MAC layer where transmissions through multiple carriers can be aggregated for which one HARQ entity is required for each serving cell In both uplink and downlink there is one independent HARQ entity for each serving cell and one transport block is generated per assignment per serving cell in the absence of spatial multiplexing Note that each transport block and its HARQ retransmissions are mapped to a single serving cell 3129 Bandwidth Adaptation BW In TSDSI RIT the receive and transmit bandwidth of a UE need not be as large as the bandwidth of the cell With bandwidth adaptation the bandwidth of the UE can be adjusted ie as an example the following parameters can be adjusted to achieve adaptability 1 Bandwidth can be ordered to change ie it can be adjusted according to the activity of the user in order to meet power constraints 2 Location can move in frequency domain in order to increase scheduling flexibility 3 Subcarrier spacing can be ordered to change to allow different services A subset of the total cell bandwidth is referred to as Bandwidth part BWP The Bandwidth adaptation is achieved by configuring UE with BWPs and letting the UE know which BWPs is currently the active one Note that a maximum of only four bandwidths can be specified in DL and UL
31210 Support for Higher Power Efficiency 312101 Network When there is no active data transfer between the network and the UE the network saves power by remaining on for some duration and sleeping for the rest The on duration consists of transmission of SSB with PBCH RMSI and paging signal which needs to be monitored by UEs During the sleep duration there is no transmission or reception tofrom the UE 312102 UE The UE can be in any one of the states at the given time 1 Idle 2 Inactive 3 Active During the idleinactive modes the UE does not perform any active data communication with the network It uses the discontinuous reception DRX cycle to save power consumption The DRX 276 Rec ITU-R M2150-2 cycle consists of an on duration and off duration which is signalled by the network to the UE During the off duration there UE sleeps there is no transmission or reception During on duration the UE performs SSB monitoring paging monitoring and radio resource management RRM measurement
This is to ensure that the UE synchronised in downlink with its network and also keeps a track of when it needs to wake up for active data transfer Once it receives a paging message the UE wakes up It starts the inactivity timer and remains active until the time expires There are two types of DRX cycles 1 long DRX cycle and 2 short DRX cycle within the off duration of the long DRX cycle The following documents provide details of the RF interface and the physical layer T39038211 NR Physical channels and modulation T39038212 NR Multiplexing and channel coding T39038213 NR Physical layer procedures for control T39038214 NR Physical layer procedures for data T39038101-1 NR User Equipment UE radio transmission and reception Part 1

Overview of the radio interface technology The IMT-2020 specifications have been developed by ETSI TC DECT and 3GPP and consist of DECT-2020 NR Releases 1 and beyond and 3GPP NR Releases 15 and beyond The specification is a set of Radio Interface Technologies RITs consisting of DECT-2020 NR as one component RIT and 3GPP NR as the other component RIT Both components are designed for operation in IMT spectrum The SRIT and the component RIT 3GPP NR fulfil all technical performance requirements in all five selected test environments Indoor Hotspot enhanced Mobile Broadband eMBB Dense Urban eMBB Rural eMBB Urban Macro Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication URLLC and Urban Macro massive Machine Type Communication mMTC The component RIT DECT-2020 NR fulfils the technical performance requirements in two selected test environments Urban Macro Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication URLLC and Urban Macro massive Machine Type Communication mMTC
Also the SRIT fulfils the service and the spectrum requirements Both component RITs DECT-2020 NR and 3GPP NR utilize the frequency bands below 6 GHz identified for International Mobile Telecommunication IMT in the ITU Radio Regulations In addition the 3GPP NR component RIT can also utilize the frequency bands above 6 GHz ie above 2425 GHz identified for IMT in the ITU Radio Regulations 411 Overview of the component RIT DECT-2020 NR 4111 General DECT-2020 NR is a Radio Interface Technology RIT designed to provide a slim but powerful technology foundation for wireless applications deployed in various use cases and markets This radio interface technology supports all kind of applications including but is not limited to Cordless Telephony Audio Streaming Applications Professional Audio Applications consumer and industrial applications of Internet of Things IoT such as industry and building automation and monitoring utility and smart city applications and in general solutions for local area deployments indoor or outdoor for Ultra-Reliable Low Latency URLLC and massive Machine Type Communication mMTC as envisioned by ITU-R for IMT-2020 In general DECT-2020 NR as a technology foundation is targeted for local area wireless applications which can be deployed anywhere by anyone at any time The technology supports autonomous and Rec ITU-R M2150-2 321 automatic operation with minimal maintenance effort Where applicable interworking functions to wide area networks WAN eg PLMN satellite fibre and internet protocols foster the vision of a network of networks DECT-2020 NR can be used as foundation for Very reliable Point-to-Point and Point-to-Multipoint Wireless Links provisioning eg cable replacement solutions Local Area Wireless Access Networks following a star topology as in classical DECT deployment supporting URLLC use cases and Self-Organizing Local Area Wireless Access Networks following a mesh network topology which enables to support mMTC use cases DECT-2020 NR applies similar design principles as in legacy DECT and DECT ULE
Especially the inherent feature of automatic interference management allows deployments without extensive frequency planning The Mesh networking capability of DECT-2020 NR enables application-driven network topologies and deployments in eg IoT and mMTC use scenarios such that the link budget of classical cellular base-station to user equipment constellations is no longer a limiting factor The DECT-2020 NR physical layer is in principle suited for addressing frequency bands below 6 GHz The physical layer employs Cyclic Prefix Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing CP-OFDM combined with Time Division Multiple Access TDMA and Frequency Division Multiple Access FDMA in a Time Division Duplex TDD communication manner
The physical layer employs multiple numerologies with different subcarrier spacings and corresponding Cyclic Prefix lengths and FFT sizes allowing operation with different channel bandwidths and optimize operations in different frequency bands and propagation environments The physical layer supports advanced channel coding Turbo coding for both control and physical channels and Hybrid ARQ with incremental redundancy which enables fast re-transmission Advanced channel coding together with Hybrid ARQ ensures very reliable communication Additionally the physical layer supports fast link adaptation transmit and receiver diversity as well as MIMO operations up to 8 streams DECT-2020 NR ie PHY layer numerology and MAC algorithms is designed to enable coexistence with legacy DECT and DECT evolution in current frequency bands allocated to DECT 4112 System and network architectures 41121 Wireless point-to-point and point-to-multipoint links Wireless point-to-point links involve two radio devices communicating with each other A typical application is the cable replacement by a wireless link established between two radio devices requiring communicating with each other
Compared to wireline systems wireless comes with the benefit that point to multipoint communication is an inherent feature of radio propagation so that the support of broadcast and multicast messages from one point to multiple points is just a matter of protocol The radio connection between two or more radio devices is enabled by one RD selecting to operate in FT mode RDFT and initiate radio resource coordination and beacon transmissions Other RDs perform association procedure in PT mode RDPT with the RDFT 41122 Local area wireless access networks in cellular network topology A single-cell network topology involves in principle two types of Radio Devices RDs an RD operates in FT mode RDFT as a base station which is a component of the fixed network infrastructure other RDs operate in PT mode RDPT 322 Rec ITU-R M2150-2 RDFT is coordinating radio resources and serves a communication cell by being the central communication point for RDPT which can be portable device A multi-cell topology is a deployment of multiple RDFT as base stations in a fixed network infrastructure where each base station is serving its own dedicated cell area and RDPT can move from one cell area to the other 41123 Mesh network topology 411231 Introduction In DECT-2020 NR mesh network devices can communicate directly to each other extending the range of network and increasing the reliability of communication The role of the involved radio devices may change autonomously depending the context of the communication Each radio device can act as a node transmitting a message as a node forwarding any message from other radio device or as a node being the destination of a message Each radio device can communicate directly device to device or if not in range indirectly via other radio devices establishing a communication route with each other which minimizes the probability of outage Mesh topology can support high device densities and the autonomous routing enables to adapt dynamically mobile users and interference Mesh operation supports autonomous routing
In order to achieve efficient mMTC operation the mesh system is scalable to very high number of devices in a network the routing is based on cost value without the need to maintain routing tables in each device The key requirements how the scalability can be achieved are All radio devices can route data Whether RD is routing data is based on an autonomous decision of the RD In addition an RD may be configured to operate in PT mode only eg due to low battery resources
Radio device does local decisions of the radio recourses eg how radio devices use Hybrid ARQ selects modulation and coding and so forth in each radio link Radio device may change their operating mode between FT mode RDFT PT mode RDPT or both FT and PT modes RDFTPT autonomously based on local decisions No central coordinators enabling the massive scale of the network Radio device operating in RDFT or RDFT PT mode coordinates local radio resources Support of multiple backend connected Radio devices that operate in FT mode RDFT RDs can operate with multiple radio channels 411232 Mesh system operation The mesh system operation is based on a clustered tree topology where each RD decides the next hop individually based available routes towards to RD providing the connection to external internet in FT mode RDFT
Each radio device has knowledge of the next uplink and downlink hop in the clustered tree and RDFT or RDFTPT in each cluster controls radio resources and transmissions independently The formation of clustered tree topology has following steps An RD which has internet connectivity RDFT in FT mode ie Sink selects operating frequency or frequencies and initiates a beacon transmission indicating that it has a route to the external world
This enables other RDs to detect it and associate with it Beacons indicate all necessary parameters how to perform association such as frame timing and how radio resources are used and the set of routing parameters This association does not differentiate from the association process in other system architectures Rec ITU-R M2150-2 323 RD detecting a beacon from another RD evaluates the connection based on the information included in the received beacon Based on the information and signal quality the RD does an independent association decision to which RDFT or RDFTPT to associate RD monitors its neighbourhood and may autonomously initiate an association process towards another RD based on routing cost Process continues to next hops and so on and it is illustrated in Fig 56 FIGURE 56 Formation of the clustered tree mesh topology Once the RD has connectivity to the next hop it can start sending data towards the RD in FT mode It can simply use a specific address value to indicate that the data is addressed to a backend A backend system or other RDs can send DL data to the associated RD
The network can have multiple back- ends sharing the same mesh network connectivity The basic beaconing and association procedures between RDs in mesh topology and in star topology are the same To enable battery powered RDs which are capable for routing data the beacon transmission interval will be longer Beaconing intervals extend to several seconds depending on the actual use case enabling low power RDs and routing RDs operations On the other hand when RD is mains powered the beaconing period could be more frequent The system operation with multiple RDs in FT mode sinks is illustrated in Fig 57
The process of forming clusters is identical and an RD may choose to change its association to the next hop RD regardless if the next hop RD will provide connectivity to a different RDFT having the backend connection Figure 57 also illustrates the case when there is an RDFTPT that does not yet have any associated RDPT 324 Rec ITU-R M2150-2 FIGURE 57 Example formation of the clusters in multiple FT scenario 411233 Mesh routing RD associates to the next hop RD based on received beacons quality attributes such as Received Signal Strength Indicator RSSI measurement from a beacon signal which assist it to determine the pathloss If both DL pathloss and UL pathloss are such that connection can be established the RD transmitting this beacon is considered as potential next hop
If RD detects multiple beacons from multiple RDs that meet the criteria of reliable connection the RD considers the route cost The route cost expresses the cost of route to deliver data to the sink ie to the RDFT that has a backend connection to the internet RD may select the RDFT or RDFTPT for association which indicates the smallest cost How RD calculates the value for route cost is left to implementation as detailed calculation can be dependent on multiple factors such as RD capabilities data rate interference and BLER own load ie data amount to be delivered available battery energy etc Route cost value will increase at least 1 in every hop The maximum route cost value is 254 which is not seen as a limiting factor in real deployments Routing has also a sink address which is the long RD ID 32 bits of the RDFT having the internet connection When system supports multiple RDFTs
the actual number of RDFTs can be significantly large RD may send short packet to backend so that that the backend can update its knowledge of where different RDs are located in the mesh network and send DL traffic only to the correct RDFT The third routing parameter application sequence number provides identification for network level application data that needs to be distributed in the DL direction to all members of the network The application sequence number is used by the RD associated to next hop to identify whether the application data has changed compared to current application data If sequence number is increased the RD requests the application data from its next hop The actual application data is outside of the scope of DECT-2020 NR but it can contain eg configuration data of the RD application such as measurement quantities and corresponding reporting frequencies etc Rec ITU-R M2150-2 325 4113 Overview of the radio technology 41131

The long radio device ID has a length of 32 bits and it identifies a radio device uniquely in a single DECT-2020 NR network An RD obtains the long RD ID as part of the authentication process over the DECT-2020 NR system or via manual provision or by using another communication channel The long RD ID is used in association procedure to recognize associating RDs uniquely in MAC layer security procedures in packet routing in mesh system operation to identify original source and final target receiver of the routed data packet 330 Rec ITU-R M2150-2 The long RD ID is transmitted in the MAC PDU to identify the receiver and the transmitter of the packet in the association procedure for exchanging short RD IDs or when transmitter of the frame considers that there is potential confusion on short RD IDs Short Radio Device ID Short RD ID
The short radio device ID has length of 16 bits and it identifies a radio device locally in the DECT-2020 NR network The short RD ID is used in the transmitter or receiver fields of the PHY control field to identify transmitter and receiver of the packet The short RD ID is exchanged during the association procedure between RDs performing association so that linkage between short RD ID and long RD ID is obtained by both associating RD Each radio device randomly selects Short RD ID value that it uses in the association 411334 Services The MAC layer provides the following services to upper layers data transfer radio resource allocation The MAC layer expects the following services from the physical layer data transfer services in physical layer packets measurements 411335 Functions

The inter-cell handovers consider changing association from an RDFT or RDFTPT into another RDFT or RDFTPT Intra-cell handover may be controlled by either the radio devices acting as RDFT or RDPT and triggered when the quality on allocated resources becomes poor and other free resources exist Detection of free resources is based on a spectrum sensing and beacon measurements and takes into account the activity of other uncoordinated systems Seamless handover is supported by allocating new resource before releasing old ones The radio device sends a handover-request part of association request process to the detected RDFT on the selected random-access channel indicated in beacon message If the RDFT accepts the request it indicates the position of the new resources and the connection is established and data delivery can be switched over After that the old resources will be released Inter-cell handover is generally controlled by the RDPT and triggered when quality on allocated resources becomes poor andor another suitable RDFT is detected Seamless handover with 0
ms interruption time is supported The RDPT sends a handover-request as indicated in intra-cell case to the new RDFT on the selected random access channel If the RDFT accepts the request then it indicates the position of the new resource allocation and the data will be switched over After that the old resource will be released Handover between two DECT-2020 NR systems is performed in the same way as inter-cell handover Both systems should be interconnected by the proper network infrastructure Rec ITU-R M2150-2 333 41135 Data Link Control 411351 DLC Entities and Architecture The DLC architecture is depicted in Fig 62 There is single routing service entity in each RD
